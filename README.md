# ESB sensing

This project develops a user-friendly mobile system and website designed to monitor environmental conditions in Environmental Specimen Banks (ESBs). The system allows for real-time data access, ensuring that users can check environmental variables anytime, enhancing the ability to maintain optimal conditions for specimen preservation.

# Physical device setting 


Use arduino code [DS18B20.ino](DS18B20.ino)on your own physical device. 


PCB design from [PCB1.PcbDoc](PCB1.PcbDoc)


# Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous tracking of environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors.


Mobile and Web Access: Seamless access through both mobile devices and a web interface to accommodate diverse user preferences.


User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design elements on both mobile and web platforms to ensure ease of use without prior technical knowledge.


Alert System: Automated notifications to alert users about critical environmental changes or deviations from set thresholds.


# Installation


Node.js (version 12.x or later)


Flutter (for mobile app development)


# Setting Up the Mobile Application


Download the apk file from action, transfer it to the android phone. Allow system to download it.


# Usage
Web Application: Build your own raspberry-pi. Access the website at http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard displaying real-time environmental data.


Mobile Application: Install the app on your mobile device and log in to monitor and receive alerts on the go.
