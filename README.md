# CASA-0022

A dissertation project of monitor freezer environment in Bio-lab.

## Connecting the physical device

outlines the setup and code for integrating a temperature monitoring system using the MKR 1010 board and DS18B20 temperature sensor, complemented by a lipo battery and a 4.7k ohm resistor for stability. The code leverages several libraries such as WiFiNINA, ezTime, PubSubClient, OneWire, and DallasTemperature to facilitate WiFi connectivity, time synchronization, and MQTT communication.
