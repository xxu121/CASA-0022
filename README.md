Mobile and Web Access: Seamless access through both mobile devices and a web interface to accommodate diverse user preferences.


User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design elements on both mobile and web platforms to ensure ease of use without prior technical knowledge.


Alert System: Automated notifications to alert users about critical environmental changes or deviations from set thresholds.

# Installation


Node.js (version 12.x or later)


Flutter (for mobile app development)


# Usage
Web Application: Build your own raspberry-pi. Access the website at http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard displaying real-time environmental data.


Mobile Application: Install the app on your mobile device and log in to monitor and receive alerts on the go.
